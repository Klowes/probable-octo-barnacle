## Testing the weirdness

start the dev server both with the "@reference 'tailwindcss';" line commented in and out within 'sheet.css'.
Toggle the commented in and out while the dev server is running in either case.
This will result in tailwind css variables being undefined in some permutations.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
